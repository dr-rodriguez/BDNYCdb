Brown Dwarf Database Structure Overview
=======================================

The BDNYC Brown Dwarf Database, existing in the file BDNYC.db, contains thirteen tables with data on over 1700 brown dwarfs.  This documentation briefly explains each table, its uses, and the data it takes.

   sources
	   
   
This is the primary list of all the brown dwarfs in the database.  It contains the "source_id," which is the unique, primary identifier of the source.  The "sources" table also has the RA and DEC (location) of the object, among other basic information.

Proper_motions

[INSERT DESCRIPTION]


Photometry
----------

Photometry on selected sources.

Telescopes
----------

This table contains all the telescopes from which the brown dwarfs in the database were discovered.  SQL also assigns an integer to each telescope as the "telescope_id," which is used in place of the name in all other tables. 


Intruments
----------

Like the "telescopes" table, this contains the list of the instruments used and a corresponding integer used in other .  


Systems
-------

List of the surveys referenced in the database.  [CHECK THIS DEFNINTION]


Spectra
-------

This table contains thousands of spectra for many of the sources.  The number of spectra varies for each source from none to dozens.  The spectra themselves are imported from ascii files (.txt) or FITS files (.fits) and the table contains identifying information for each spectrum.  This includes units, wavelength order (for high resolution spectra), observation date, instrument, telescope, airmass. 


Parallaxes
----------

Measured parallaxes for hundreds of objects.

Spectral_types
--------------

Contains (primarily) spectral type, gravity, and regime for many objects in the database.

Spectral types for brown dwarfs are "L", "T", and "Y".  In this table, "spectral_type" is represented by an integer, with 0=L, 10=T, and 20=Y.  For example, a T4.5 dwarf would be entered as 14.5.  


Publications
------------

Similar to telescope_id and intrument_id, the publication_id of a source is an integer assigned to the paper in which the brown dwarf was discovered.  This table contains hundreds of publication_ids and their corresponding papers.
