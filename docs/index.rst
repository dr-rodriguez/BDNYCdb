Welcome to BDNYC Database documentation
=======================================

Interaction with the Brown Dwarf Database through Python requires one or more of the modules specifically designed for that purpose.  Those modules are BDdb.py, utilities.py, astrotools.py, and load_db.py.  This documentation of those modules details the purpose of each module, what arguments it takes, and the type it accepts.  Proper use of these modules requires access to the BDNYC database and Github to ensure up to-date code.
